Welcome to AmpTorch's documentation!
====================================


*AmpTorch* is a PyTorch implementation of the `Atomistic
Machine-learning Package <https://amp.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`__
(AMP) code that seeks to provide users with improved performance and
flexibility as compared to the original code. The implementation does so
by benefiting from state-of-the-art machine learning methods and
techniques to be optimized in conjunction with high-throughput
supercomputers. *AmpTorch* is built on top of `PyTorch
Geometric <https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`__ and
`Skorch <https://skorch.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`__.
